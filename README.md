This repository aims to collect resources relating to workflow and tooling
choices that promote reproducibility and best practice in data analysis and data science projects.   

The resources have been organised as:  

+ R Packages   
+ Books   
+ Papers  
+ Blog Posts  
+ Talks and Videos   

If you would like to make a contribution, I would be glad to include it. Please
file an issue, submit a PR or email me on [deanmarchiori@gmail.com](mailto:deanmarchiori@gmail.com)
